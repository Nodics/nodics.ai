# cms Agent Contract

This file gives AI coding agents mandatory guidance for this Nodics module or package boundary.

## Inheritance

- Follow the repository AGENTS contract: `../../AGENTS.md`.
- Follow the parent WCMS contract and the `nodics.foundation` runtime contracts.
- If a deeper child module has its own `AGENTS.md`, follow that file for changes inside the child module.

## Module Work Rules

- Treat this directory as a layered Nodics module boundary when it contains `package.json`.
- Keep capabilities stable and make implementations replaceable through the module hierarchy.
- Do not hardcode project, environment, server, node, tenant, or customer behavior into reusable framework code.
- Put configurable behavior in layered configuration, schemas, routers, services, pipelines, data, and runtime governance.
- Update the concise `README.md`, canonical documentation content, `llm/contracts`, `llm/examples`, generated context, and tests whenever behavior or extension contracts change.
- Use `llm/contracts` for exact module-local AI/developer rules, `llm/examples` for approved patterns, and `llm/generated` for source-derived facts. Do not add a module-local llm README file; this `AGENTS.md` is the AI navigation and behavior entrypoint for the module.
- Generated files must be recreated from source definitions; do not hand-maintain generated artifacts as source of truth.
- Storefront-bound public delivery accepts only the page path and an opaque
  Storefront handle. Validate the handle through service-authenticated
  Storefront introspection for the `cms` audience; never trust caller Site,
  tenant, enterprise, locale, or channel overrides and never copy Storefront
  context authority into CMS.

This capability declares an inert model-service inventory for [governed Local reset](../../../nodics.foundation/modules/nSystem/llm/contracts/local-reset.md).
A server must explicitly select it; contributions never enable reset or bypass tenant, environment, confirmation or required-service checks.

Route-category defaults belong to this capability; deployments supply only intentional overrides.
Preserve nRouter enforcement and independent route authorization. See [exposure ownership](../../../nodics.foundation/modules/nRouter/llm/contracts/README.md#capability-owned-exposure-defaults).

CMS owns generic guided-publication acceptance defaults: select the WCMS_STAGED
runtime and an enabled initialization profile using the framework `foundation`
template. Application publication selections, Site identities and delivery probes
belong to their accelerator or customer pack. Defaults never install or publish data.
